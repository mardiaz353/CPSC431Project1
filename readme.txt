Mauricio Macias: Mauricio did all the front end work on this project. He created the user login.php, registration.php,
				 registrationVerify.php, register.html, index.html, and query.php He created the login and
				 registration processes with authentification. He created the code to display items and information from the 
				 database.

			She wrote the sorting algorithm that sorts and displays the items by price and name. She created 
			checkout.php which displays the items in the carts and calculates the total cost including taxes.
